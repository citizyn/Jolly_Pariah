3D Printing, CNC machining, Mad-Scientist stuff.

I'm a 25-year CNC Machinist who writes his own G-Code programs using DraftSight Pro. I use my Tevo Tarantula 3D printer (That I assembled from a kit) to make patterns for castings for firearm designs I'm in the middle of the patent-application process with. 

I've recently purchased some machinable-wax filament to do lost-wax-investment castings, so I can skip the pattern-making step of foundry-work. Haven't used it yet.

I do my 3D Modelling with OpenScad and Blender. I've joined GitHub looking for code for a 3D Model Viewer I can write into the HTML for my website once the patents are applied for. I can't show-off my work until I've secured the design.
